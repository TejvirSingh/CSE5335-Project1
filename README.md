# Web Data Management Project CSE-5335

1. ##What server framework did you choose and why?
>>####RUBY on RAILS was used as the server framework for this project. I chose ruby on rails because i thought that node.js is also a javascript framework and i wanted to learn something different other than javascript. 

2. ##What client framework did you choose and why?
>>####AngularJS was used as the client framework that is going to make the ajax calls to the server. And then handle the response from the server. 

3. ##What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
>>####Implementation of AngularJS with the html code was easy. 

4. ##What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
>>####Installing, Implementing and creating application ruby on rails. And setting up all the routes and application related information. Understanding the flow of the files in rails was a bit difficult for me. 
>>####Working on parsing the json files and reading the json format in angularjs was a bit difficult. 


5. ##What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
>>####Bundler ver 1.13 was installed other than the client and server framework. This basically helps in managing the gems that needs to be installed as part of the dependencies.
